|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**          | The person who uses the application to create a new place listing.          |
| **API**           | Receives user requests and routes them to the appropriate business layer.   |
| **BusinessFacade**| A design pattern that serves as an intermediary between API and logic.      |
| **BusinessLogic** | Handles all validation and business rules related to place creation.        |
| **Database**      | Stores the persistent data including the new place records.                 |

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User Sends Request**  
   The user initiates a request to create a new place by submitting the necessary details (title, description, price, etc.) to the API.

2. **API Forwards to Facade**  
   The API receives the request and forwards it to the BusinessFacade layer for processing.

3. **Facade Forwards to Logic**  
   The BusinessFacade delegates the request to the BusinessLogic component, which contains the rules for validating and handling the data.

4. **BusinessLogic Validates and Saves**  
   BusinessLogic checks the validity of the data. If valid, it creates a new record in the database.

5. **Confirmation Propagates**  
   Once the data is saved, a confirmation message is returned step-by-step from the database to BusinessLogic, then to the facade, and finally to the API.

6. **API Responds to User**  
   The API returns a final confirmation or error message to the user based on the result.
